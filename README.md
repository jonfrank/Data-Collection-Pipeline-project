# Data-Collection-Pipeline-project

This is the second project in AiCore - a webscraper based on Selenium. I've chosen to get campsite data as my test case, from [pitchup.com](https://pitchup.com/campsites/England).

**TO DO**: needs more documentation here!

Relies on local copy of AWS credentials and access to the bucket (as configure near the top of the file).
